This project is a test of development knowledge in React-Redux .
### Pokedex
Using [PokeAPI v2](https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/#) we implement a lot of patterns and adiciontal libraries making a Pokedex with the follow features:
- List all pokemons with filter by name and Dex ID. _(TODO: list pokemons by type)_
- Manage my own Pokedex Library by adding and removing Pokemons
- Show detailed information of a selected Pokemon such as:
    - Name
    - Image
    - Evolution chain
    - Abilities and short effects _(TODO: this last one)_
    - Types
    - Stats info

***TODO***
 - Make pokemons list filter by Pokemon type
 - Show ability effect on click event
 - Custom Pokemon image upload
 
### How to setup and run
Just run `yarn install` and `npm start`, no addictional actions required.

### Tests
`npm test` yep, that is it.
